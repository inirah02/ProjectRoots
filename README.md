# ProjectRoots
Cisco ThingQbator Project
Project Roots had its inception as an idea in October 2021, when my friend and I wanted to use our technical background and creative ideologies to build tangible solutions that would remove social stigmas attached to neurological health challenges faced by the most neglected section of the World’s population; Senior Citizens.  
  
  
As my domain of interest lies in Computational Cognition, I wanted to build a project that solved a real world problem in the healthcare space and also exponentiate my technical experience while building it. Cognitive Specialists from NIMHANS and various neurologists helped us validate our idea and help understand the users from a microscopic point of view. Patients and caregivers from numerous Old Age Homes and Care centers also expressed their needs, which boosted the project's morale. 
  
We developed a Flutter app with personalized set of cognitive games to stimulate the mind and help maintain cognitive function for better memory reinforcement and to-do reminders for Dementia patients. Visual and memory based games are a fun haven for senior citizens. All the games will be based on crucial information to the patient (collected through a query form and stored in firebase database ) thus, cognitive reinforcement is emphasized. features include :

1. Word Search: Classic word search game with a grid of letters and the user has to find key words or answers based on the hints on the hints page
    
2. Reverse spell: User has to type the reverse spelling of the word thrown at him / her by the app (voice cue). User can click on repeat word to hear the word again .
    
3. Picture Quiz: Visual based questionnaire for visual memory reinforcement. Implemented a dashboard to track the number of right and wrong answers.
    
4. To-do reminders: User can create a to-do check list , tick off tasks , add new tasks and delete old ones(not integrated with firebase database yet)
  
Seeing the smiles on our users was the ultimate reward, the impact of our solution in real-time, exponentiated our motivation and hope that with Project Roots, the rates of cognitive decline rapidly decrease around the globe and the burden on caregivers is significantly reduced.
